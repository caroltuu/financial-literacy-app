<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
# About The Project

### Inspiration
A lot of the things we start from a young age stick with us as we grow older. We decided to remedy today's gap in financial literacy with this principle- and encourage children, with the guidance of their parents and our program, to learn how to manage their allowance money, and learn the concepts of interest, taxes, and even stock trading in the process.

### What it does
Parents can create an account for themselves and their child. The parent, after connecting their bank account to the program, can add money to their child's account (digitalize allowance), subtract money from their child's account, set interest rates, provide interest on their child's savings, and give stock revenue . The child is able to manage their money online and experiment with different ways to increase their earnings with what they have.

### How we built it
We incorporated Capital One's API on the backend, which gave us various methods to create and modify users, accounts, and relevant information. The server takes in inputs from the create or login screen, and presents the personalized information to the user. 

### Challenges we ran into
We ran into various challenges with passing variables from the user interface to the server, the server through the API methods, and the resulting variables back to the frontend. Another issue was that the Capital One API doesn't instantaneously process transfers/deposits/withdrawls, which meant that we had to establish our own global variable. We also established our own database to store and connect user and account information.

### Accomplishments that we're proud of


### What we learned
That live server on VSCode is a thingðŸ¤¯

### What's next
Expanding on paper trading (real time buy and sell options), incorporating analytics and visuals of past transactions, and fixing some frontend issues
